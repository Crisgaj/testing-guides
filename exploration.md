# Exploration & Regression

**FCC CUTS VIDS**

A test touring heuristic.

* Feature tour: Move through the application and get familiar with all the controls and features you come across.
* Complexity tour: Find the five most complex things about the application.
* Claims tour: Find all the information in the product that tells you what the product does.
* Configuration tour: Attempt to find all the ways you can change settings in the product in a way that the application retains those settings.
* User tour: Imagine five users for the product and the information they would want from the product or the major features they would be interested in.
* Testability tour: Find all the features you can use as testability features and/or identify tools you have available that you can use to help in your testing.
* Scenario tour: Imagine five realistic scenarios for how the users identified in the user tour would use this product.
* Variability tour: Look for things you can change in the application - and then you try to change them.
* Interoperability tour: What does this application interact with?
* Data tour: Identify the major data elements of the application.
* Structure tour: Find everything you can about what comprises the physical product \(code, interfaces, hardware, files, etc…\).

**RCRCRC**

A regression testing heuristic.

* Recent: new features, new areas of code are more vulnerable
* Core: essential functions must continue to work
* Risk: some areas of an application pose more risk
* Configuration sensitive: code that’s dependent on environment settings can be vulnerable
* Repaired: bug fixes can introduce new issues
* Chronic: some areas in an application may be perpetually sensitive to breaking
