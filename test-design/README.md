# Test Design

Test Design is about creating effective tests. 

This catalog is an attempt to research and consolidate the valuable test design content out there in the world and bring it into one place. Maybe one day I'll create a separate website for the social good of the software community. I believe articles, videos, books and examples that others can use to develop competence in these skills will help the community at large.
