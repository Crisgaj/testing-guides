# Regression Testing

**RCRCRC**

A regression testing heuristic.

* Recent: new features, new areas of code are more vulnerable
* Core: essential functions must continue to work
* Risk: some areas of an application pose more risk
* Configuration sensitive: code thatâ€™s dependent on environment settings can be vulnerable
* Repaired: bug fixes can introduce new issues
* Chronic: some areas in an application may be perpetually sensitive to breaking
