# Domain Testing Schema Overview

- What are the potentially interesting variables? 
- Which variable are you analyzing?
- What is the primary dimension of this variable?
- What is the type and scale of the primary dimension?
- Can you order the variable?
- Is this variable an input or result?  Why?
- How does the program use this variable?
- What other variables are related to this one?
- How would you partition the variable?
- Lay out the analysis in a classical boundary/equivalence table, including best representatives.
- What tests would you create for the consequences? 
- What are some of the secondary dimensions that apply to this variable? 
- Summarize your analysis with a risk/equivalence table.
- Analyze independent variables that should be tested together
- Analyze variables that hold results
- Analyze non-independent variables. Deal with relationships and constraints
- Identify and list unanalyzed variables. Gather information for later analysis
- Imagine and document risks that don't necessarily map to obvious dimension
