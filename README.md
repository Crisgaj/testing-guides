# Testing Guide

This is my testing guide. It is filled with catalogs, heuritics, guidewords, cheat sheets, lists, links and other models I find useful. 

_This is still very much a work in progress as I figure out how to best focus and use it._

* Sometimes I like catalogs
* Sometimes I like checklists
* Sometimes I like guides
* Sometimes I like cheat sheets
* I almost always love models
