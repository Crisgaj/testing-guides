# Testing Guides & Catalog

Having a good catalog or guide to reference (either one you created or this one) should be part of every software tester + developers toolbox. The following are meant to help with specific and more generalized testing, to provoke ideas for finding failures.

Catalogs and Guides provide Test Ideas. Sometimes they're going to be applicable, sometimes they won't and still other times they won't be worth testing.

## TOC

Definitely need a table of contents.
