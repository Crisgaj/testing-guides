# Testing Catalog & Guide

You can develop a standard set of tests for a specific type of object (or risk) and reuse the set for similar things in this and/or later products. Marick (1994) suggested that testers develop these types of lists and called them test idea catalogs. 

Having a good catalog to reference should be part of every software tester + developers toolbox. The following are meant to help with specific and more generalized testing, to provoke ideas for finding failures.

*This is still very much a work in progress as I figure out how to best focus and use it. Currently it is too large and not focused enough on test ideas*

- Sometimes I like catalogs
- Sometimes I like checklists
- Sometimes I like guides
- Sometimes I like cheat sheets
- I almost always love models
